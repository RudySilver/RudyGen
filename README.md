# RudyGen

RudyGen is a local password generator built for people who care about security, OPSEC, and staying in control of their own systems.

It does one thing and does it well.
It generates strong passwords and explains why they are strong.

Nothing leaves your machine.
Nothing is saved.
Nothing is tracked.


Privacy and OPSEC

RudyGen runs entirely on your local machine.

It does not use the internet.
It does not log anything.
It does not store passwords.
It has no analytics, telemetry, or background behavior.

If your computer is offline, RudyGen works.
If someone is watching network traffic Using RudyGuard, RudyGen is invisible.

The password exists only in your terminal, at that moment.



**RudyGen** is a fast, secure password generator that runs locally on your machine.  
No cloud. No tracking. Just strong passwords when you need them.

Part of a larger idea

RudyGen is meant to live alongside other tools like RudyGuard and RudyScript.

Each tool is small.
Each tool is focused.
Each tool is understandable.

The goal is not complexity.
The goal is awareness and control.


Why this exists

Security is not about fear.
Privacy is not something to justify.
Open source is how people learn what their tools actually do.

RudyGen exists to encourage people to build, share, and understand their own security tools instead of trusting black boxes.

If this tool helps you, fork it.
Change it.
Improve it.
Use it as a base for something better.

That is how open source stays alive.

Use it, modify it, share it.
