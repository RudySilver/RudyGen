Privacy & OPSEC

    No internet access: RudyGen runs locally — no cloud, no tracking.

    No logs: It does not store passwords or collect data.

    Offline ready: If your computer is offline, RudyGen still works.

    Invisible: If you're using RudyGuard, RudyGen is undetectable.

Philosophy

    Security is about taking control.

    Privacy is a right.

    Open source means transparency.

RudyGen exists to help you build your own tools for privacy and security. If it helps, fork it, change it, and make it better.

That's how open source stays alive.
